Implement the Line class which will contain (as a composition) the instance of
two Point2D object from task 1. Those points should be the start and end point
of the line. In addition, this class should implement:
two-arguments constructor: begin point, end point
four-arguments constructor accepting 4 parameters: coordinates of the start
and end point
getter method which will be responsible for returning start and end points
setter method which will be responsible for setting start and end points
the method responsible for calculating the length of the line based on the
set points
the method responsible for returning the coordinates of the point being the
center of the created line
Please provide an example usage of above implementation
