Implement the Line class which will contain (as a composition) the instance of two Point2D object from task 1. //ok
Those points should be the start and end point of the line. In addition, this class should implement:      //ok
two-arguments constructor: begin point, end point      //ok
four-arguments constructor accepting 4 parameters: coordinates of the start  //ok
and end point                                                                //ok
getter method which will be responsible for returning start and end points   //ok
setter method which will be responsible for setting start and end points     //ok
the method responsible for calculating the length of the line based on the   //ok
set points
the method responsible for returning the coordinates of the point being the  //ok
center of the created line
Please provide an example usage of above implementation
