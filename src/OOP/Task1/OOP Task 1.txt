TASK 1
Point2D class
Implement the Point2D class. It should contain:
two float fields : x , y //ok
non-arguments constructor which will set x , y fields to 0 //ok
two-arguments constructor: float x , float y //ok
getter methods which will be responsible for returning x , y fields values //ok
getXY method which will return x , y values as two-element array //ok
setter methods which will be responsible for setting x , y fields values //ok
setXY method which will be responsible for setting x and y //ok
toString method which should return string in the following format: (x,
y)//ok

Point3D class
Using the Point2D class implement the Point3D class. It should extend the //ok
Point2D class. It should contain:
private float field: z  //ok
three-arguments constructor: float x , float y , float z //ok
getter method which will be responsible for returning the z field value  //ok
getXYZ method which will return x , y , z values as three-element array //ok
setter method which will be responsible for setting the z field value //ok
setXYZ method which will be responsible for setting x , y , z  //ok
toString method which should return string in the following format: (x,    //ok
y, z)
Please provide an example usage of above implementation
