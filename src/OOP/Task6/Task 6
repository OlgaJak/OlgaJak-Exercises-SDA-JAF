Implement the Movable interface which will contain a definition of common methods for movablePoint and movableCircle
classes.
void moveUp()
void moveDown()
void moveLeft()
void moveRight()

MovablePoint class
The MovablePoint class should implement the Movable interface and should
contain 4 fields: int:x,y,xSpeed,ySpeed. The x,y fields should define the coordinates of point
and the xSpeed, ySpeed fields should determine how much yhe appropriate coordinates should change.

the moveUp() and the moveDown() method should increase/decrease the
y coordinate by provided ySpeed value

the moveLeft() and the moveRight() method should increase/decrease
the x coordinate by provided xSpeed value


MovableCircle class
The MovableCircle class should implement the Movable interface and should
contain (as a composition) instance of MovablePoint class. It should contain
fields necessary to define circle radius.

the moveUp() and the moveDown() method should increase/decrease the
y coordinate from MovablePoint instance by provided ySpeed value

the moveLeft and the moveRight() method should increase/decrease the
x coordinate from MovablePoint instance by provided xSpeed value

Please provide an example usage of above implementation. Please consdier to
present polymorphism as well
