Implement the GeometricObject interface which should contain common
behaviours definition for each sub class:
double getPerimeter();
double getArea();

Circle class
The Circle class should implement the GeometricObject interface and it
should contain the radius field. Methods from Geometric interface should be implemented
according to the mathematical rules.

Resizable interface
The Resizable interface should declare the resize(int percent) method
which will be responsible for rescaling objects which are implementing created
interface.

ResizableCircle class
The ResizableCircle class should implement Resizable interface. The
resize method from interface should reduce the radius of the circle in
percentage.
Please provide an example usage of above implementation.
